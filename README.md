Hi! I'm currently a sophomore computer science student attending Stevens Institute of Technology.

My repositories are mainly composed of classwork and extra programming I've done outside of class. 

The languages that I have past experience in are:
- Java
- Python
- C++
- HTML, CSS, and JS
- Racket / Scheme
- Some Assembly (in the form of LEGV8).
- C#
- C
In addition to coding, I'm big into video games and love painting!
